## User Guide

### How to Redeem a Book
The eStricted Section allows for an individual to redeem books under a student's name. To redeem a book, begin by clicking on the desired student from the leftmost list and then clicking on the desired book from the rightmost list and finally clicking the redeem button in the center. The redemption will then be committed to a table at the bottom of the program with a unique redemption ID and the date in which the redemption was made (important information of both the book and the student are also recorded). 

## How to Add a Student
The eStricted Section allows for an individual to add students into the leftmost student list. To add a student, click the "Add Student" button below the leftmost list. The "Add Student" form will pop up over the main page. Simply type inside the presented text fields to the right of the bolded prompts. If a field is left blank, or if the e-mail address is entered incorrectly, the student’s information will not be added to the table at the bottom of the program under the "Current Students:" label. Once all text fields have been filled, clicking the “Add Student” button to the right of the eStricted Section logo will add the information to the table at the bottom of the current "Add Student" form and to the leftmost list of the program’s main screen.

## How to Add a Book

The “Add Book” form will pop up over the main page. Simply type inside the presented text fields to the right of the bolded prompts. If a field is left blank, the book’s information will not be added to the table at the bottom of the program under the “Current books:” label. Once all text fields have been filled, clicking the “Add Book” button below the eStricted Section logo will add the information to the table at the bottom of the current "Add Book" form and to the rightmost list of the program’s main screen.

## How to Save all Data
The eStricted Section allows for an individual to save his or her data so that it may be returned to at a later date. Clicking the “Save” button in the centermost column on the main page will save the data in the redemption table (table at the bottom of the program’s main screen).

## How to Delete Redemptions
The eStricted Section allows for an individual to delete redemptions from the bottom redemption table. Clicking any redemption in the redemption table (table at the bottom of the program’s main screen) will highlight the entire row. Clicking the “Delete” button in the centermost column on the main page will display the “Delete Redemption” pop up. Clicking the “Yes” button will delete the redemption from the table and clicking the “No” button will keep the redemption in the table. 

## How to View the Weekly Report
The eStricted Section allows for an individual to view a weekly report of all redeemed books. Clicking the “Weekly Report” button in the centermost column on the main page will save the current data in the redemption table (table at the bottom of the program’s main screen) and the “Report” form will pop up over the main page. Clicking the “<Prior Week” button will decrement the date by seven days, showing the redeemed books of the prior week. Clicking the “Next Week>” button will increment the date by seven days, showing the redeemed books of the following week. Altering the "Start" and "End" dates within the date pickers located under the "<Prior Week" and "Next Week>" will display the redeemed books in between the chosen "Start" and "End" dates. In order for the program to work correctly the starting date had to be one day behind, redemptions made on the actual date not appearing otherwise.
