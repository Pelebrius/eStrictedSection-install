## User Guide

### How to Redeem a Book
The E-Stricted Section allows for an individual to redeem books under a student's name. To redeem a book, begin by clicking on the desired student from the leftmost list and then clicking on the desired book from the rightmost list and finally clicking the redeem button in the center. The redemption will then be committed to a table at the bottom of the program with a unique redemption ID and the date in which the redemption was made (important information of both the book and the student are also recorded). 

## How to Add a Student
The E-Stricted Section allows for an individual to add students into the leftmost student list. To add a student, click the "Add Student" button below the leftmost list. The "Add Student" form will pop up in place of the main screen. Simply type inside the given text fields to the right of the bolded prompts. If a field is left blank, or if the e-mail address is entered incorrectly, the student’s information will not be added to the table at the bottom of the program under the "Current Students:" label. Once all text fields have been filled, clicking the “Add Student” button to the right of the E-Stricted Section logo will add the information to the table at the bottom of the current form and to the leftmost table of the program’s main screen.

## How to Add a Book
The E-Stricted Section allows for an individual to add books into the rightmost book list. To add a book, click the “Add book” button below the rightmost list. The “Add book” form will pop up in place of the main screen. Simply type inside the given text fields to the fight of the bolded prompts. If a field is left blank the book’s information will not be added to the table at the bottom of the program under the “Current books:” label. Once all text fields have been filled, clicking the “Add Book” button below the E-Stricted Section logo will add the information to the table at the bottom of the current form and to the rightmost table of the program’s main screen.

## How to Save all Data
The E-Stricted Section allows for an individual to save his or her data so that it may be returned to at a later date. Clicking the “Save” button in the centermost column on the main screen will save the data in the redemption table (table at the bottom of the program’s main screen). Clicking the “Menu” button in the top left corner of the main screen and then clicking the “Save” button from there will also save the data in the redemption table.
## How to Delete Redemptions
The E-Stricted Section allows for an individual to delete redemptions from the bottom redemption table. Clicking any redemption in the redemption table (table at the bottom of the program’s main screen) will highlight the entire row. Clicking the “Delete” button in the centermost column on the main screen will display the “Delete Redemption” pop up. Clicking the “Yes” button will delete the redemption from the table and clicking the “No” button will keep the redemption in the table. 
## How to View the Weekly Report
The E-Stricted Section allows for an individual to view a weekly report of all redeemed books. Clicking the “Weekly Report” button in the centermost column of buttons will bring up the “Save Data” pop up. If information in the redemption table (table at the bottom of the program’s main screen) has not been saved, the additions to the table will not show up in the weekly report. It is recommended that the information be saved before continued on to the report. If the information is saved, simply click the “Yes” button and the “Report” form will pop up over the main screen. Clicking the “<Prior Week” button will decrement the date by seven days, showing the redeemed books of the prior week. Clicking the “Next Week>” button will increment the date by seven days, showing the redeemed books of the following week. In order for the program to work correctly the starting date had to be one day behind, redemptions made on the actual date not appearing otherwise.
